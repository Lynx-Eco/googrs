More than almost any other city, San Francisco is truly a “City of Neighborhoods”. And no matter how you count or define them, the number of neighborhoods will vary depending on who you ask.  When living in or moving to San Francisco, choosing the right neighborhood is one of the most important decisions you will have to make. Selecting the best neighborhood for you is important for a lot of different reasons.

**Defining The “Best” San Francisco Neighborhoods**
---------------------------------------------------

Best is a pretty loaded word. It’s judgy and harsh and what you and everyone else wants to search for. What makes a neighborhood in San Francisco the best? We aren’t exactly sure and we don’t think anyone else is either; it varies by neighborhood. One of the wonderful things about San Francisco is that each neighborhood has a distinct character, flavor, and style that creates a vibe in that neighborhood that is unique from any and everywhere else in the city.

It’s what makes [SOMA](https://jacksonfuller.com/sf/south-of-market-2/) gritty and industrial while [St. Francis Wood](https://jacksonfuller.com/sf/st-francis-wood/) retains its elegant residential park vibe. Every [San Francisco neighborhood](https://jacksonfuller.com/neighborhoods/) is great at something, and while you may think that’s just millennial coddling, after two decades (and counting) of living in, exploring, and selling San Francisco we think that every San Francisco neighborhood is the best at something.

**Our List of the 14 Best San Francisco Neighborhoods**
-------------------------------------------------------

Explore the diverse charm of San Francisco with our curated list of the 14 best neighborhoods, each offering a unique blend of character and lifestyle.

1\. Castro – Best neighborhood to walk around naked
---------------------------------------------------

“Sun’s out, guns out” is taken to another level in The Castro. Until the 1960’s, the Castro was largely a white working-class Irish neighborhood known as “Eureka Valley.”  It was gentrified in the 1970s when discharged gay soldiers from World War II who had stuck around, along with plenty of other open-minded underdogs, created the gayborhood during a decade of white flight.

Today, beautiful, carefully maintained Victorians and Edwardians line the streets of the Castro, many of them belonging to the [Victorian Alliance of San Francisco](https://www.victorianalliance.org/). Also lining these streets are the world-famous [Naked Guys](https://thebolditalic.com/hanging-out-with-sf-s-naked-guys-the-bold-italic-san-francisco-10c2dd8c1f08) of SF. Public nudity? How can it be? Well, urban nudists are technically following the letter of the law by not exposing their “genitals, perineum, or anal region.” On main thoroughfares in the sex-positive Castro if the goods are covered, they probably won’t be hassled — except by tourists clambering for a photo.

2\. Presidio Heights: Best place to bump into a billionaire
-----------------------------------------------------------

Nestled just south of The Presidio, Presidio Heights stands out as one of the city’s destination neighborhoods, offering a unique blend of elegance and tranquility. With large family homes of historic note situated on some of the largest lots in The City, Presidio Heights is home to millionaire and billionaire residents who can easily afford the neighborhood’s premium pricing.

Renowned for its picturesque tree-lined streets, grand Victorian and Edwardian mansions, and proximity to the iconic Presidio, Presidio Heights provides a peaceful retreat from the urban bustle while maintaining convenient access to city amenities.

3\. Inner Sunset: Best place to enjoy Golden Gate Park
------------------------------------------------------

[![Image 3](blob:https://jacksonfuller.com/21e30043ef77294c87ad0790bcdc50cb)](https://jacksonfuller.com/sf/inner-sunset/)The Inner Sunset stands out as one of San Francisco’s best neighborhoods due to its unique blend of amenities, community spirit, and cultural richness. Nestled along the southern border of the expansive Golden Gate Park, residents benefit from immediate access to the park’s recreational offerings and world-class institutions, from ball fields to museums. The area boasts a diverse culinary scene, featuring an array of restaurants and cafes catering to various tastes, from ethnic cuisine to trendy eateries. The neighborhood’s charming residential streets showcase Victorian and Edwardian-style homes, creating an aesthetically pleasing and architecturally rich environment.

The Inner Sunset is celebrated for its strong sense of community, with local events and a welcoming atmosphere that fosters connections among residents. Excellent public transportation options, including Muni buses and the N-Judah light rail line, enhance the neighborhood’s accessibility and connectivity to other parts of the city. Moreover, the presence of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Parnassus campus adds an academic dimension, attracting a diverse and dynamic population. Overall, the Inner Sunset encapsulates the quintessential San Francisco experience, combining natural beauty, cultural vibrancy, and a close-knit community, making it one of the most coveted neighborhoods in the city.

4\. Hayes Valley: Best place to people-watch
--------------------------------------------

Hayes Valley, a charming central San Francisco neighborhood was once bisected by freeways but is now renowned for its people-watching, arts and culture and walkability. A neighborhood that has been around for almost as long as the city, the streets showcase a mix of [Victorian](https://jacksonfuller.com/victorian-homes-for-sale/) and Edwardian structures alongside contemporary townhomes and apartment complexes. The real estate definition of the neighborhood includes the Lower Haight aka The Haight-Filmore area, central to the 1960s bohemian hippie movement. John Muir Elementary School and other educational facilities are nearby and cater to the diverse community. Parks and green spaces, such as Patricia’s Green, provide recreational opportunities, while the Church of 8 Wheels offers roller skating fun for all ages.

The neighborhood’s eponymous street hosts trendy shops and restaurants like MAC and Absinthe Brasserie, adding to the neighborhood’s allure. Its appeal is further heightened by its proximity to Civic Center attractions, including museums and concert halls. Hayes Valley stands as a vibrant blend of history, culture, and contemporary living in the heart of San Francisco.

5\. Pacific Heights: Best place to find homes featured in movies
----------------------------------------------------------------

Many films and TV shows have been filmed in San Francisco. When driving around the Pacific Heights neighborhood, you might think you are on a Hollywood set. [Mrs. Doubtfire](https://youtu.be/RzZsdL-EGwg?si=B1BAlFEsvSM7RjJ_). The Princess Diaries. Pursuit of Happyness. The Rock. Tales Of The City.  All had parts filmed within this small neighborhood in the north of San Francisco.

Flowers at Mrs. Doubtfire House in Pacific Heights

Pacific Heights is an upscale residential neighborhood in San Francisco that’s known for its historic architecture, much of which dates to the first monied settlers to arrive in our fair city. Some historic buildings are open to the public. It’s also famed for billionaire residents and record-breaking real estate values. It’s been called the most exclusive neighborhood in the nation by Business Insider, and a high number of technology magnates live here.

Other reasons to visit Pacific Heights include its upscale boutiques, white-tablecloth restaurants, historic real estate, and magnificent mansions. It’s a place to visit if you want to fill your Instagram feed with photos of glorious architecture and colorful homes. If you’re looking for posh and chic shopping experiences, 5-star restaurants, and the feeling of living like royalty, Pacific Heights is a great destination.

6\. Russian Hill: Best place for bay views
------------------------------------------

[![Image 5](blob:https://jacksonfuller.com/7c2db6831bc480a3416b2f7030558559)](https://jacksonfuller.com/sf/russian-hill/)

Russian Hill is directly to the north (and slightly down hill) from [N](https://jacksonfuller.com/sf/nob-hill/)[ob Hi](https://jacksonfuller.com/sf/nob-hill/)[ll](https://jacksonfuller.com/sf/nob-hill/), uphill and to the south of [Fisherman’s Wharf](https://www.jacksonfuller.com/sf/north-waterfront/), and uphill and west of the [North Beach](https://jacksonfuller.com/sf/north-beach/) neighborhood. Russian Hill is bordered on its we

st side by Van Ness Avenue. At the northern foot of the hill is Ghirardelli Square, home to the iconic Fontana East and Fontana West on the waterfront of the San Francisco Bay and near Aquatic Park, and Fisherman’s Wharf, a popular tourist area. A trip down the winding turns of Lombard Street and across Columbus Avenue to the east leads to the neighborhood of North Beach.

Because of the steepness of the hill, many streets, portions of Vallejo and Green Streets, f

or example, are staircases. Views from the top of the hill extend in several directions around the Bay Area, including the [Bay Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco%E2%80%93Oakland_Bay_Bridge), [Marin County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marin_County), the [Golden Gate Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate_Bridge) and [Alcatraz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcatraz). You’ll find The Royal Towers and The Summit at 999 Green perched at the top of the iconic hill with unparalleled views.

7\. Glen Park: Best place to access I-280 and BART: A Commuter Wonderland
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Glen Park is directly to the south of Noe Valley and is known for its beautiful green parks and desirable homes along the neighborhood’s rolling hills. Glen Park features a mix of modern bungalow-style homes as well as more contemporary, architecturally styled homes. With a family-friendly atmosphere and lots of parks like Glen Canyon and other natural spaces at your exposure, this area is loved by young families with kids.

[![Image 6](blob:https://jacksonfuller.com/04b5b5864526408d0032883d146aa253)](https://jacksonfuller.com/sf/glen-park-2/)

Glen Park is also a commuter’s paradise, if such a thing exists… Glen Park residents consistently point to the [neighborhood’s BART station](https://www.bart.gov/stations/glen) as one of its major perks. Despite feeling removed from the hustle and bustle of downtown San Francisco, residents can take BART to the Financial District in 10 minutes. Trains run very frequently on weekdays since four of the system’s five lines service the station. Glen Park also offers easy access to Interstate 280, convenient for those who commute south to Silicon Valley.

8\. Bayview: Best place to learn about black history in SF
----------------------------------------------------------

Bayview is one of the sunniest neighborhoods in San Francisco, home to breathtaking nature, a burgeoning creative scene and diverse sights and bites. It’s also one of the oldest business districts in California and has a significant legacy of African-American religious, civic, cultural, athletic, educational and technological achievements. It’s one of the best places in SF to learn about, and walk through, Black history.

[![Image 7](blob:https://jacksonfuller.com/9e6a26dd0778fab9224edfc4b85c2430)](https://jacksonfuller.com/sf/bayview-hunters-point/)

There’s a long list of people, places, and things to do that will help you learn more about the neighborhood’s history.

9\. Bernal Heights: Best place for your dog to make a friend
------------------------------------------------------------

Often described as a quaint urban village, Bernal Heights is as family-friendly as [Noe Valley](https://www.sfgate.com/local/article/noe-valley-17759968.php), as funky — yet quieter **—** than [the Mission District](https://www.sfgate.com/local/article/mission-district-san-francisco-17484040.php), and has views that rival any other [hilltop neighborhood](https://www.sfgate.com/local/article/san-francisco-hills-17700185.php) in San Francisco. Once the site of a mini gold rush — which turned up no gold — the neighborhood grew from a “[lawless upstart](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Bernal-Heights-a-San-Francisco-1906-survivor-9452382.php)” filled with cow pastures to the favored home and hangout for the city’s progressives, artists, LGBTQ+ community — and even the occasional [mountain lion.](https://www.sfgate.com/local/article/mountain-lion-bernal-heights-park-gaven-sighting-16186411.php)

And Bernal Heights loves its dogs. Bernal Heights Park is one of San Francisco’s most popular and breathtaking off-leash dog play areas. Here you can enjoy breathtaking 360-degree panoramic views of San Francisco Bay, the Golden Gate Bridge, downtown, and San Bruno Mountain. Dog walkers, joggers, trail runners, bird-watchers, and picnic-goers all flock to the park for its amazing views, open grassy hills, and the abundance of friendly dogs that are allowed to play and roam freely. The park stretches out over 26 acres, making it one of the larger off-leash dog play areas in San Francisco.

10\. Mission Dolores: Best way to eat your way through SF
---------------------------------------------------------

Del-Fina. Bi-Rite. Dolores Park Cafe. Tartine. That’s just one block of 18th Street between Dolores and Guerrero. The Mission is one of the most eclectic and multicultural neighborhoods in the city, which makes it one of the most delicious to dine in. The Mission food scene started decades ago, when young and upcoming chefs took note of the neighborhood’s once-cheap restaurant rents. Now plenty of shops are food-tourist destinations with regular queues at the door.

[![Image 8](blob:https://jacksonfuller.com/b86cdf615174c592f42f49320167cbb9)](https://jacksonfuller.com/sf/mission-dolores/)

From unlicensed vendors in Dolores Park to Michelin starred experiences, you can find almost every kind of delicious delight to sate your appetite in Mission Dolores. To the extent that you are able, plan on walking or biking in the neighborhood. Street parking is the norm, and neighborhood residents are already using it.

[Homes for Sale in Mission Dolores](https://www.jacksonfuller.com/sf/mission-dolores/)

11\. Sherwood Forest: Best place to never meet Robin Hood
---------------------------------------------------------

Even the legendary “Merry Man,” _San Francisco Chronicle_ columnist Herb Caen, got lost looking for Robinhood Drive on his way to Thanksgiving dinner in Sherwood Forest, hidden as it is on the southwesterly slope of Mount Davidson.

[![Image 9](blob:https://jacksonfuller.com/010839df2d1508130d29bbe77e3c874d)](https://jacksonfuller.com/sf/sherwood-forest/)

The Sherwood Forest neighborhood is still distinguished by the original globe streetlights. An irreverent article about the [West of Twin Peaks District](https://www.outsidelands.org/wotp.php) neighborhoods described Sherwood Forest as being crowned with “some of the more elaborate ranch-style homes to be found in San Francisco.”

You’ll find colonial-style columns, weathervanes atop “carriage houses” and plenty of faux-rock walls. Is it kitsch, avant-garde, or unintentionally ironic? That’s for you to judge. Enjoy the dense groves of eucalyptus, cypress, and pines on Mount Davidson in a neighborhood that began as an upper-middle-class enclave of post world war two-era homes.

12\. Forest Hill: Best Unexpected Place to Own a Grand Single-Family Home with Great Muni Light-Rail Access
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Forest Hill is one of eight master-planned residence parks in San Francisco on lands that once belonged to Adolph Sutro.  Forest Hill is near the geographic middle of the City of San Francisco, southeast of the Inner Sunset and northeast of West Portal. You’ll find winding boulevards with lush plantings home to some iconic single family homes built by noted SF architects.

[![Image 10](blob:https://jacksonfuller.com/575967270cdf90b30a7a325f6c0805c3)](https://jacksonfuller.com/sf/forest-hill/)

While the neighborhood is known for its single family homes, it is also served by the Forest Hill muni station, making it delightfully simple to get to downtown or other destinations without driving. While the neighborhood boundaries are roughly Seventh Avenue/Laguna Honda Boulevard to the north and east, Taraval Street to the south, and 14th Avenue to the west, you’ll find the MUNI station on the southeast edge of the neighborhood

[Homes for Sale in Forest Hill](https://www.jacksonfuller.com/sf/forest-hill/)

13\. Pine Lake Park: Best neighborhood for access to Stern Grove
----------------------------------------------------------------

The region surrounding Lake Merced, known as the Lakeshore area, underwent development in the period just preceding and following World War II, aiming to be a “model community.” It featured an array of housing options, including single-family homes, apartments, and townhouses. Like many other SF neighborhoods, the real estate here was cutting-edge when constructed. A walk from Lake Merced to Fort Funston provides a glimpse of what big parts of  Western San Francisco resembled before urbanization: expansive sand dunes adorned with a scattering of hardy flowers and trees.

[![Image 11: Stern Grove](blob:https://jacksonfuller.com/0da86e39a41107b3de4aee96ca72d1c3)](https://jacksonfuller.com/sf/pine-lake-park/)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The neighborhood is home to San Francisco State University, the Stonestown Galleria is a notable neighborhood destination and you’ll also find Stern Grove, the Olympic Golf Club, Harding Park Municipal Golf Course, and the San Francisco Golf Club. Pine Lake Park, a cluster of family residences, forms an enclave directly adjacent to Stern Grove.

[Homes for Sale in Pine Lake Park](https://jacksonfuller.com/sf/pine-lake-park/)

14\. Corona Heights: Best for downtown views
--------------------------------------------

Rising more than 500 feet above central San Francisco and the shores of Ocean Beach, this mostly residential neighborhood is known for its eponymous park with a kids’ museum, trails and a beloved dog run. Streets in the neighborhood can be wide and flat, straight and narrow, or steep and winding, and are served by several buses and two nearby Muni lines. Surrounding neighborhoods offer shops and nightlife, but way up here you can enjoy peace, quiet and jaw-dropping views of downtown from some homes.

[![Image 12: Corona Heights Park](blob:https://jacksonfuller.com/0a30dec0e6acb4d6be4638299bfb1062)](https://jacksonfuller.com/sf/corona-heights/)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An eclectic, elegant mix of detached homes and condos, Corona Heights housing travels through time from the Victorian era to present-day. Expect to see single-family homes mixed with detached town homes and small condo buildings. Park Hill, formerly St. Joseph’s Hospital and a backdrop for Alfred Hitchcock’s “Vertigo,” is the neighborhood’s largest condo complex directly across from Buena Vista Park.

**Factors to Consider When Choosing the Best San Francisco Neighborhood**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Budget**

Being “house-poor” isn’t fun. So understanding how much you can afford means making tradeoffs between San Francisco neighborhoods. While no neighborhood in SF is “cheap” you’ll find that the cost of housing varies widely as you traverse the hills and valleys of San Francisco’s best neighborhoods. While property taxes will be based on purchase price no matter where you live, what you get for what you are taxed on will vary widely. And that’s before we factor in transit time to schools, recreation, or anything else.

### **Commute**

Where are you spending your days now? Where are you likely to be spending them in the future? How do you want to get there? Some neighborhoods in SF offer great access to muni bus or light rail lines, while others are adored for their BART stops or stalked for their convenient on-ramps. Planning for your daily commute is a pivotal factor when selecting a neighborhood due to its major impact on daily life and your sense of well-being. The time and convenience of your daily travels significantly affect work-life balance, family time, and personal stress levels. Proximity to workplaces, schools, and essential services not only reduces commuting time but also minimizes transportation costs. Shorter commutes contribute to increased productivity and overall job satisfaction. Moreover, a neighborhood’s accessibility to public transportation and major thoroughfares influences ease of travel and connectivity, fostering a more efficient and enjoyable lifestyle. Considering commute in your decision-making process ensures a harmonious balance between professional commitments and personal pursuits, optimizing your overall living experience.

### **Housing Style**

The age, style, shape, and characteristics of San Francisco housing stock vary wildly from one neighborhood to the next. The Sunset is known for single-family homes built primarily in the 1940s while you’re most likely to find a bungalow in Westwood Park. Full-amenity high-rises with valet and concierge services might be the norm in South Beach, but building heights like that are not allowed in most SF neighborhoods.

![Image 13: Victorian Houses in San Francisco](blob:https://jacksonfuller.com/9d75abcf64ec5cc52d7502ab9411d342)

Housing type is a crucial consideration when choosing a neighborhood as it directly shapes your living experience and lifestyle. Different neighborhoods offer diverse housing options, ranging from single-family homes to apartments or condominiums. The type of residence affects factors such as privacy, space, and maintenance responsibilities. Families may prioritize neighborhoods with spacious houses and yards, while young professionals might prefer the convenience of apartments in vibrant urban areas. Moreover, housing types impact community dynamics and the sense of belonging. Assessing your preferences and needs helps align your lifestyle with the neighborhood’s offerings, ensuring that your chosen housing type enhances your overall well-being and fits seamlessly with your daily routines and aspirations.

### **Amenities**

The neighborhood _is_ the amenity. The shops and services that are a short distance from your front door will become part of the fabric of your daily life. Some neighborhoods in San Francisco like The Castro or Hayes Valley are easily walkable and have lots of convenient shops, dry cleaners, restaurants, and other services easily available. Other neighborhoods like Clarendon Heights or Midtown Terrace were built with the assumption that you own at least one car and plan on driving to most places you go.

Amenities can be vital factors in choosing a neighborhood as they directly impact the overall lifestyle and value of a residence. Proximity to reputable schools influences educational opportunities and property values, making it crucial for families. Within a home, high-end appliances contribute to the comfort and functionality of a home, enhancing daily living standards.

In larger buildings, doorpeople and front desk staff provide both security and convenience, adding to the sense of safety and luxury. Amenities contribute to the long-term desirability and resale value of a property. Considering such features ensures that your chosen neighborhood aligns with specific needs, preferences, and aspirations, creating a living environment that not only meets immediate requirements but also offers a lasting and high-quality residential experience.

### **Weather**

Microclimates are a thing. If you like to sleep with your windows open and want to snuggle under a blanket in July while fog whispers through your windows, the Outer Sunset or Outer Richmond might delight you. If waking up to sunny skies and warmer temperatures is a requirement, then heading east of Twin Peaks to neighborhoods like The Mission or Mission Bay will leave you with a much sunnier disposition. Wind can delight or aggravate, and some parts of the city get a lot more of it than others, particularly when the temperature changes between the afternoon and evening.

### **History & Historic Use**

The Marina was once part of the bay and much of it is built on in-fill from the 1906 earthquake. Soil compaction and liquefaction may be of concern due to the history of how the neighborhood was built. The Shipyard was once Hunter’s Point Shipyard, with a variety of industrial and naval uses that may or may not still linger in the neighborhood.

Anza Vista was once home to a cemetery while the Parkside was sand dunes for as far as the eye could see. SF neighborhoods currently filled with a diverse collection of homes and people may have begun as something much different, and depending on your personal preferences understanding how your current neighborhood came to be may or may not be important.

Markdown Content:
More than almost any other city, San Francisco is truly a “City of Neighborhoods”. And no matter how you count or define them, the number of neighborhoods will vary depending on who you ask.  When living in or moving to San Francisco, choosing the right neighborhood is one of the most important decisions you will have to make. Selecting the best neighborhood for you is important for a lot of different reasons.

**Defining The “Best” San Francisco Neighborhoods**
---------------------------------------------------

Best is a pretty loaded word. It’s judgy and harsh and what you and everyone else wants to search for. What makes a neighborhood in San Francisco the best? We aren’t exactly sure and we don’t think anyone else is either; it varies by neighborhood. One of the wonderful things about San Francisco is that each neighborhood has a distinct character, flavor, and style that creates a vibe in that neighborhood that is unique from any and everywhere else in the city.

It’s what makes [SOMA](https://jacksonfuller.com/sf/south-of-market-2/) gritty and industrial while [St. Francis Wood](https://jacksonfuller.com/sf/st-francis-wood/) retains its elegant residential park vibe. Every [San Francisco neighborhood](https://jacksonfuller.com/neighborhoods/) is great at something, and while you may think that’s just millennial coddling, after two decades (and counting) of living in, exploring, and selling San Francisco we think that every San Francisco neighborhood is the best at something.

**Our List of the 14 Best San Francisco Neighborhoods**
-------------------------------------------------------

Explore the diverse charm of San Francisco with our curated list of the 14 best neighborhoods, each offering a unique blend of character and lifestyle.

1\. Castro – Best neighborhood to walk around naked
---------------------------------------------------

“Sun’s out, guns out” is taken to another level in The Castro. Until the 1960’s, the Castro was largely a white working-class Irish neighborhood known as “Eureka Valley.”  It was gentrified in the 1970s when discharged gay soldiers from World War II who had stuck around, along with plenty of other open-minded underdogs, created the gayborhood during a decade of white flight.

[![Image 1](blob:https://jacksonfuller.com/428db1a9ce3090447c941e2dc5528297)](https://jacksonfuller.com/sf/castro-eureka-valley/)

Today, beautiful, carefully maintained Victorians and Edwardians line the streets of the Castro, many of them belonging to the [Victorian Alliance of San Francisco](https://www.victorianalliance.org/). Also lining these streets are the world-famous [Naked Guys](https://thebolditalic.com/hanging-out-with-sf-s-naked-guys-the-bold-italic-san-francisco-10c2dd8c1f08) of SF. Public nudity? How can it be? Well, urban nudists are technically following the letter of the law by not exposing their “genitals, perineum, or anal region.” On main thoroughfares in the sex-positive Castro if the goods are covered, they probably won’t be hassled — except by tourists clambering for a photo.

9\. Bernal Heights: Best place for your dog to make a friend
------------------------------------------------------------

Often described as a quaint urban village, Bernal Heights is as family-friendly as [Noe Valley](https://www.sfgate.com/local/article/noe-valley-17759968.php), as funky — yet quieter **—** than [the Mission District](https://www.sfgate.com/local/article/mission-district-san-francisco-17484040.php), and has views that rival any other [hilltop neighborhood](https://www.sfgate.com/local/article/san-francisco-hills-17700185.php) in San Francisco. Once the site of a mini gold rush — which turned up no gold — the neighborhood grew from a “[lawless upstart](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Bernal-Heights-a-San-Francisco-1906-survivor-9452382.php)” filled with cow pastures to the favored home and hangout for the city’s progressives, artists, LGBTQ+ community — and even the occasional [mountain lion.](https://www.sfgate.com/local/article/mountain-lion-bernal-heights-park-gaven-sighting-16186411.php)

The Mission is one of the most eclectic and multicultural neighborhoods in the city, which makes it one of the most delicious to dine in.

11\. Sherwood Forest: Best place to never meet Robin Hood
---------------------------------------------------------

Even the legendary “Merry Man,” _San Francisco Chronicle_ columnist Herb Caen, got lost looking for Robinhood Drive on his way to Thanksgiving dinner in Sherwood Forest, hidden as it is on the southwesterly slope of Mount Davidson.

[![Image 9](blob:https://jacksonfuller.com/010839df2d1508130d29bbe77e3c874d)](https://jacksonfuller.com/sf/sherwood-forest/)

The Sherwood Forest neighborhood is still distinguished by the original globe streetlights. An irreverent article about the [West of Twin Peaks District](https://www.outsidelands.org/wotp.php) neighborhoods described Sherwood Forest as being crowned with “some of the more elaborate ranch-style homes to be found in San Francisco.”

You’ll find colonial-style columns, weathervanes atop “carriage houses” and plenty of faux-rock walls. Is it kitsch, avant-garde, or unintentionally ironic? That’s for you to judge. Enjoy the dense groves of eucalyptus, cypress, and pines on Mount Davidson in a neighborhood that began as an upper-middle-class enclave of post world war two-era homes.

12\. Forest Hill: Best Unexpected Place to Own a Grand Single-Family Home with Great Muni Light-Rail Access
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Forest Hill is one of eight master-planned residence parks in San Francisco on lands that once belonged to Adolph Sutro.  Forest Hill is near the geographic middle of the City of San Francisco, southeast of the Inner Sunset and northeast of West Portal.

While the neighborhood boundaries are roughly Seventh Avenue/Laguna Honda Boulevard to the north and east, Taraval Street to the south, and 14th Avenue to the west, you’ll find the MUNI station on the southeast edge of the neighborhood

13\. Pine Lake Park: Best neighborhood for access to Stern Grove
----------------------------------------------------------------

The region surrounding Lake Merced, known as the Lakeshore area, underwent development in the period just preceding and following World War II, aiming to be a “model community.” It featured an array of housing options, including single-family homes, apartments, and townhouses. Like many other SF neighborhoods, the real estate here was cutting-edge when constructed. A walk from Lake Merced to Fort Funston provides a glimpse of what big parts of  Western San Francisco resembled before urbanization: expansive sand dunes adorned with a scattering of hardy flowers and trees.

[![Image 11: Stern Grove](blob:https://jacksonfuller.com/0da86e39a41107b3de4aee96ca72d1c3)](https://jacksonfuller.com/sf/pine-lake-park/)

14\. Corona Heights: Best for downtown views
--------------------------------------------

Rising more than 500 feet above central San Francisco and the shores of Ocean Beach, this mostly residential neighborhood is known for its eponymous park with a kids’ museum, trails and a beloved dog run. Streets in the neighborhood can be wide and flat, straight and narrow, or steep and winding, and are served by several buses and two nearby Muni lines. Surrounding neighborhoods offer shops and nightlife, but way up here you can enjoy peace, quiet and jaw-dropping views of downtown from some homes.

**Factors to Consider When Choosing the Best San Francisco Neighborhood**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Budget**

Being “house-poor” isn’t fun. So understanding how much you can afford means making tradeoffs between San Francisco neighborhoods. While no neighborhood in SF is “cheap” you’ll find that the cost of housing varies widely as you traverse the hills and valleys of San Francisco’s best neighborhoods. While property taxes will be based on purchase price no matter where you live, what you get for what you are taxed on will vary widely. And that’s before we factor in transit time to schools, recreation, or anything else.

### **Commute**

Where are you spending your days now? Where are you likely to be spending them in the future? How do you want to get there? Some neighborhoods in SF offer great access to muni bus or light rail lines, while others are adored for their BART stops or stalked for their convenient on-ramps. Planning for your daily commute is a pivotal factor when selecting a neighborhood due to its major impact on daily life and your sense of well-being. The time and convenience of your daily travels significantly affect work-life balance, family time, and personal stress levels. Proximity to workplaces, schools, and essential services not only reduces commuting time but also minimizes transportation costs. Shorter commutes contribute to increased productivity and overall job satisfaction. Moreover, a neighborhood’s accessibility to public transportation and major thoroughfares influences ease of travel and connectivity, fostering a more efficient and enjoyable lifestyle. Considering commute in your decision-making process ensures a harmonious balance between professional commitments and personal pursuits, optimizing your overall living experience.

### **Housing Style**

The age, style, shape, and characteristics of San Francisco housing stock vary wildly from one neighborhood to the next. The Sunset is known for single-family homes built primarily in the 1940s while you’re most likely to find a bungalow in Westwood Park. Full-amenity high-rises with valet and concierge services might be the norm in South Beach, but building heights like that are not allowed in most SF neighborhoods.

![Image 13: Victorian Houses in San Francisco](blob:https://jacksonfuller.com/9d75abcf64ec5cc52d7502ab9411d342)

Housing type is a crucial consideration when choosing a neighborhood as it directly shapes your living experience and lifestyle. Different neighborhoods offer diverse housing options, ranging from single-family homes to apartments or condominiums. The type of residence affects factors such as privacy, space, and maintenance responsibilities. Families may prioritize neighborhoods with spacious houses and yards, while young professionals might prefer the convenience of apartments in vibrant urban areas. Moreover, housing types impact community dynamics and the sense of belonging. Assessing your preferences and needs helps align your lifestyle with the neighborhood’s offerings, ensuring that your chosen housing type enhances your overall well-being and fits seamlessly with your daily routines and aspirations.

### **Amenities**

The neighborhood _is_ the amenity. The shops and services that are a short distance from your front door will become part of the fabric of your daily life. Some neighborhoods in San Francisco like The Castro or Hayes Valley are easily walkable and have lots of convenient shops, dry cleaners, restaurants, and other services easily available. Other neighborhoods like Clarendon Heights or Midtown Terrace were built with the assumption that you own at least one car and plan on driving to most places you go.

Amenities can be vital factors in choosing a neighborhood as they directly impact the overall lifestyle and value of a residence. Proximity to reputable schools influences educational opportunities and property values, making it crucial for families. Within a home, high-end appliances contribute to the comfort and functionality of a home, enhancing daily living standards.

In larger buildings, doorpeople and front desk staff provide both security and convenience, adding to the sense of safety and luxury. Amenities contribute to the long-term desirability and resale value of a property. Considering such features ensures that your chosen neighborhood aligns with specific needs, preferences, and aspirations, creating a living environment that not only meets immediate requirements but also offers a lasting and high-quality residential experience.

### **Weather**

Microclimates are a thing. If you like to sleep with your windows open and want to snuggle under a blanket in July while fog whispers through your windows, the Outer Sunset or Outer Richmond might delight you. If waking up to sunny skies and warmer temperatures is a requirement, then heading east of Twin Peaks to neighborhoods like The Mission or Mission Bay will leave you with a much sunnier disposition. Wind can delight or aggravate, and some parts of the city get a lot more of it than others, particularly when the temperature changes between the afternoon and evening.

### **History & Historic Use**

The Marina was once part of the bay and much of it is built on in-fill from the 1906 earthquake. Soil compaction and liquefaction may be of concern due to the history of how the neighborhood was built. The Shipyard was once Hunter’s Point Shipyard, with a variety of industrial and naval uses that may or may not still linger in the neighborhood.

Anza Vista was once home to a cemetery while the Parkside was sand dunes for as far as the eye could see. SF neighborhoods currently filled with a diverse collection of homes and people may have begun as something much different, and depending on your personal preferences understanding how your current neighborhood came to be may or may not be important.

One of San Francisco's most colorful neighborhoods, [the Mission District](https://www.ihg.com/trip-extras/us/en/restaurants/add?hotelLatitude=37.7599&hotelLongitude=-122.4148) boasts countless murals and bold street art in every direction. The Mission has long been a lively Latin American enclave, and as you admire the dynamic artwork, you'll discover the vibrant culture that permeates the district. This is the perfect spot to sample the best Salvadoran pupusas, Mexican tacos and Latin American street food in the city. Like many San Francisco neighborhoods, the Mission has evolved since the Bay Area's tech boom. Beside decades-old taquerias, you'll find hip coffee shops such as [Four Barrel](https://www.fourbarrelcoffee.com/), French bakeries such as [Tartine](http://www.tartinebakery.com/) and upscale restaurants such as [Californios](http://www.californiossf.com/), making the Mission one of San Francisco's most fascinating districts.

Just west of the Mission, [the Castro District](https://www.ihg.com/trip-extras/us/en/restaurants/add) is known for its vibrant LGBT culture, its colorful nightlife scene and its many green spaces. Though the Castro was once considered suburban San Francisco, today, the F-line streetcars make this neighborhood easy to access from tourist hot spots like [Fisherman's Wharf](https://www.ihg.com/trip-extras/us/en/activities/add).

As a first-time visitor, consider touring the [GLBT History Museum](http://www.glbthistory.org/museum/) to explore how the district came to be, and both new and repeat visitors should take the opportunity to catch a show at the historic [Castro Theatre](http://www.castrotheatre.com/), which shows both new blockbusters and cult films. During the day, take a stroll through Mission Dolores Park or Corona Heights Park, and in the evening, dance the night away at one of the Castro's many nightclubs.

Haight-Ashbury is famous for sparking the counterculture movement in the 1960s, and today, it still maintains an offbeat, open-minded vibe. If you want to step back in time to the late 1960s, make a pilgrimage to the Grateful Dead House, which the five founding members once called home. Stop by [Amoeba Music](https://www.amoeba.com/) to browse for retro vinyl and new recordings, and do some shopping in the many vintage stores that line Haight Street.

Kick back and relax in beautiful Buena Vista Park or in Golden Gate Park, which is on the western edge of the neighborhood. Then settle into one of the Haight's many jazz bars for a laid-back evening.

San Francisco is home to numerous districts that offer unique vibes to experience, attractions to explore and flavors to sample. While you won't have time to visit every corner of the city during a typical weekend getaway, you should put these five San Francisco neighborhoods at the top of your to-do list.

One of San Francisco's most colorful neighborhoods, [the Mission District](https://www.ihg.com/trip-extras/us/en/restaurants/add?hotelLatitude=37.7599&hotelLongitude=-122.4148) boasts countless murals and bold street art in every direction. The Mission has long been a lively Latin American enclave, and as you admire the dynamic artwork, you'll discover the vibrant culture that permeates the district. This is the perfect spot to sample the best Salvadoran pupusas, Mexican tacos and Latin American street food in the city. Like many San Francisco neighborhoods, the Mission has evolved since the Bay Area's tech boom. Beside decades-old taquerias, you'll find hip coffee shops such as [Four Barrel](https://www.fourbarrelcoffee.com/), French bakeries such as [Tartine](http://www.tartinebakery.com/) and upscale restaurants such as [Californios](http://www.californiossf.com/), making the Mission one of San Francisco's most fascinating districts.

![Image 2: The Castro](https://www.ihg.com/content/us/en/guides/san-francisco-ca/sanfrancisco-neighborhoods)

Find it on [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The%20Castro,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA/@37.7625574,-122.4536772,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808f7e1b3606d49d:0xc9a66606d5327c89!8m2!3d37.7609082!4d-122.4350043).

Just west of the Mission, [the Castro District](https://www.ihg.com/trip-extras/us/en/restaurants/add) is known for its vibrant LGBT culture, its colorful nightlife scene and its many green spaces. Though the Castro was once considered suburban San Francisco, today, the F-line streetcars make this neighborhood easy to access from tourist hot spots like [Fisherman's Wharf](https://www.ihg.com/trip-extras/us/en/activities/add).

As a first-time visitor, consider touring the [GLBT History Museum](http://www.glbthistory.org/museum/) to explore how the district came to be, and both new and repeat visitors should take the opportunity to catch a show at the historic [Castro Theatre](http://www.castrotheatre.com/), which shows both new blockbusters and cult films. During the day, take a stroll through Mission Dolores Park or Corona Heights Park, and in the evening, dance the night away at one of the Castro's many nightclubs.

Haight-Ashbury is famous for sparking the counterculture movement in the 1960s, and today, it still maintains an offbeat, open-minded vibe. If you want to step back in time to the late 1960s, make a pilgrimage to the Grateful Dead House, which the five founding members once called home. Stop by [Amoeba Music](https://www.amoeba.com/) to browse for retro vinyl and new recordings, and do some shopping in the many vintage stores that line Haight Street.

Kick back and relax in beautiful Buena Vista Park or in Golden Gate Park, which is on the western edge of the neighborhood. Then settle into one of the Haight's many jazz bars for a laid-back evening.

One of the largest Chinatowns in the United States, San Francisco's Chinatown has long been a hub for the city's Chinese population. Today, Chinatown is one of the most densely populated neighborhoods in the city, and you'll find no shortage of [things to do, see and eat](https://www.ihg.com/trip-extras/us/en/activities/add). Set your sights on the impressive Dragon Gate, which marks the southern entrance to the neighborhood. Then follow the street vendors as you make your way north on Grant Avenue.

Cow Hollow, Haight, Russian Hill and the area by Embarcadero if they can afford it and are single. If they are married with kids on the way, a little further out: Twin Peaks, the eastern Sunset District, Sea Cliff and Pacific Heights.  
  
If they are not quite so well off, Noe Valley, Mission or maybe even Potrero Hill.  
  
But really there are thousands of amazing little nooks in the city. It all depends what you are in to and what you are willing to deal with.
