# An SF Local’s Guide to the 14 “Best” San Francisco Neighborhoods

More than almost any other city, San Francisco is truly a “City of Neighborhoods”. And no matter how you count or define them, the number of neighborhoods will vary depending on who you ask.  When living in or moving to San Francisco, choosing the right neighborhood is one of the most important decisions you will have to make. Selecting the best neighborhood for you is important for a lot of different reasons.

Best is a pretty loaded word. It’s judgy and harsh and what you and everyone else wants to search for. What makes a neighborhood in San Francisco the best? We aren’t exactly sure and we don’t think anyone else is either; it varies by neighborhood. One of the wonderful things about San Francisco is that each neighborhood has a distinct character, flavor, and style that creates a vibe in that neighborhood that is unique from any and everywhere else in the city. 

Explore the diverse charm of San Francisco with our curated list of the 14 best neighborhoods, each offering a unique blend of character and lifestyle.

“Sun’s out, guns out” is taken to another level in The Castro. Until the 1960’s, the Castro was largely a white working-class Irish neighborhood known as “Eureka Valley.”  It was gentrified in the 1970s when discharged gay soldiers from World War II who had stuck around, along with plenty of other open-minded underdogs, created the gayborhood during a decade of white flight. 

Today, beautiful, carefully maintained Victorians and Edwardians line the streets of the Castro, many of them belonging to the Victorian Alliance of San Francisco

## 2. Presidio Heights: Best place to bump into a billionaire

Nestled just south of The Presidio, Presidio Heights stands out as one of the city’s destination neighborhoods, offering a unique blend of elegance and tranquility. With large family homes of historic note situated on some of the largest lots in The City, Presidio Heights is home to millionaire and billionaire residents who can easily afford the neighborhood’s premium pricing.

Renowned for its picturesque tree-lined streets, grand Victorian and Edwardian mansions, and proximity to the iconic Presidio, Presidio Heights provides a peaceful retreat from the urban bustle while maintaining convenient access to city amenities. Residents enjoy a sense of community, with California Street offering convenient local boutiques, gourmet dining options, and cultural attractions. 

The Inner Sunset is celebrated for its strong sense of community, with local events and a welcoming atmosphere that fosters connections among residents. Excellent public transportation options, including Muni buses and the N-Judah light rail line, enhance the neighborhood’s accessibility and connectivity to other parts of the city. Moreover, the presence of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Parnassus campus adds an academic dimension, attracting a diverse and dynamic population. Overall, the Inner Sunset encapsulates the quintessential San Francisco experience, combining natural beauty, cultural vibrancy, and a close-knit community, making it one of the most coveted neighborhoods in the city.

Hayes Valley, a charming central San Francisco neighborhood was once bisected by freeways but is now renowned for its people-watching, arts and culture and walkability. A neighborhood that has been around for almost as long as the city, the streets showcase a mix of Victorian

The neighborhood’s eponymous street hosts trendy shops and restaurants like MAC and Absinthe Brasserie, adding to the neighborhood’s allure. Its appeal is further heightened by its proximity to Civic Center attractions, including museums and concert halls. Hayes Valley stands as a vibrant blend of history, culture, and contemporary living in the heart of San Francisco.

## 5. Pacific Heights: Best place to find homes featured in movies

Many films and TV shows have been filmed in San Francisco. When driving around the Pacific Heights neighborhood, you might think you are on a Hollywood set. Mrs. Doubtfire

Pacific Heights is an upscale residential neighborhood in San Francisco that’s known for its historic architecture, much of which dates to the first monied settlers to arrive in our fair city. Some historic buildings are open to the public. It’s also famed for billionaire residents and record-breaking real estate values. It’s been called the most exclusive neighborhood in the nation by Business Insider, and a high number of technology magnates live here. 

Other reasons to visit Pacific Heights include its upscale boutiques, white-tablecloth restaurants, historic real estate, and magnificent mansions. It’s a place to visit if you want to fill your Instagram feed with photos of glorious architecture and colorful homes. If you’re looking for posh and chic shopping experiences, 5-star restaurants, and the feeling of living like royalty, Pacific Heights is a great destination.

st side by Van Ness Avenue. At the northern foot of the hill is Ghirardelli Square, home to the iconic Fontana East and Fontana West on the waterfront of the San Francisco Bay and near Aquatic Park, and Fisherman’s Wharf, a popular tourist area. A trip down the winding turns of Lombard Street and across Columbus Avenue to the east leads to the neighborhood of North Beach. 

Because of the steepness of the hill, many streets, portions of Vallejo and Green Streets, f

or example, are staircases. Views from the top of the hill extend in several directions around the Bay Area, including the Bay Bridge

## 7. Glen Park: Best place to access I-280 and BART: A Commuter Wonderland

 Glen Park is directly to the south of Noe Valley and is known for its beautiful green parks and desirable homes along the neighborhood’s rolling hills. Glen Park features a mix of modern bungalow-style homes as well as more contemporary, architecturally styled homes. With a family-friendly atmosphere and lots of parks like Glen Canyon and other natural spaces at your exposure, this area is loved by young families with kids. 

Glen Park is also a commuter’s paradise, if such a thing exists… Glen Park residents consistently point to the neighborhood’s BART station

## 8. Bayview: Best place to learn about black history in SF

Bayview is one of the sunniest neighborhoods in San Francisco, home to breathtaking nature, a burgeoning creative scene and diverse sights and bites. It’s also one of the oldest business districts in California and has a significant legacy of African-American religious, civic, cultural, athletic, educational and technological achievements. It’s one of the best places in SF to learn about, and walk through, Black history. 

 Attend an open studio event at The Point, home to one of the largest concentrations of working artists in the U.S. Or visit the restored Bayview Opera House, built in 1888. Enjoy soul food spots like Old Skool Café or oysters on the half-shell at The Old Clam House. Radio Africa & Kitchen blends Mediterranean, Californian and African cuisines. There’s a long list of people, places, and things to do that will help you learn more about the neighborhood’s history.

## 9. Bernal Heights: Best place for your dog to make a friend

Often described as a quaint urban village, Bernal Heights is as family-friendly as Noe Valley

And Bernal Heights loves its dogs. Bernal Heights Park is one of San Francisco’s most popular and breathtaking off-leash dog play areas. Here you can enjoy breathtaking 360-degree panoramic views of San Francisco Bay, the Golden Gate Bridge, downtown, and San Bruno Mountain. Dog walkers, joggers, trail runners, bird-watchers, and picnic-goers all flock to the park for its amazing views, open grassy hills, and the abundance of friendly dogs that are allowed to play and roam freely. The park stretches out over 26 acres, making it one of the larger off-leash dog play areas in San Francisco. 

## 10. Mission Dolores: Best way to eat your way through SF

Del-Fina. Bi-Rite. Dolores Park Cafe. Tartine. That’s just one block of 18th Street between Dolores and Guerrero. The Mission is one of the most eclectic and multicultural neighborhoods in the city, which makes it one of the most delicious to dine in. The Mission food scene started decades ago, when young and upcoming chefs took note of the neighborhood’s once-cheap restaurant rents. Now plenty of shops are food-tourist destinations with regular queues at the door. 

From unlicensed vendors in Dolores Park to Michelin starred experiences, you can find almost every kind of delicious delight to sate your appetite in Mission Dolores. To the extent that you are able, plan on walking or biking in the neighborhood. Street parking is the norm, and neighborhood residents are already using it. 

## 11. Sherwood Forest: Best place to never meet Robin Hood

The Sherwood Forest neighborhood is still distinguished by the original globe streetlights. An irreverent article about the West of Twin Peaks District

You’ll find colonial-style columns, weathervanes atop “carriage houses” and plenty of faux-rock walls. Is it kitsch, avant-garde, or unintentionally ironic? That’s for you to judge. Enjoy the dense groves of eucalyptus, cypress, and pines on Mount Davidson in a neighborhood that began as an upper-middle-class enclave of post world war two-era homes. 

## 12. Forest Hill: Best Unexpected Place to Own a Grand Single-Family Home with Great Muni Light-Rail Access

Forest Hill is one of eight master-planned residence parks in San Francisco on lands that once belonged to Adolph Sutro.  Forest Hill is near the geographic middle of the City of San Francisco, southeast of the Inner Sunset and northeast of West Portal. You’ll find winding boulevards with lush plantings home to some iconic single family homes built by noted SF architects. 

While the neighborhood is known for its single family homes, it is also served by the Forest Hill muni station, making it delightfully simple to get to downtown or other destinations without driving. While the neighborhood boundaries are roughly Seventh Avenue/Laguna Honda Boulevard to the north and east, Taraval Street to the south, and 14th Avenue to the west, you’ll find the MUNI station on the southeast edge of the neighborhood 

## 13. Pine Lake Park: Best neighborhood for access to Stern Grove

The region surrounding Lake Merced, known as the Lakeshore area, underwent development in the period just preceding and following World War II, aiming to be a “model community.” It featured an array of housing options, including single-family homes, apartments, and townhouses. Like many other SF neighborhoods, the real estate here was cutting-edge when constructed. A walk from Lake Merced to Fort Funston provides a glimpse of what big parts of  Western San Francisco resembled before urbanization: expansive sand dunes adorned with a scattering of hardy flowers and trees.

 The neighborhood is home to San Francisco State University, the Stonestown Galleria is a notable neighborhood destination and you’ll also find Stern Grove, the Olympic Golf Club, Harding Park Municipal Golf Course, and the San Francisco Golf Club. Pine Lake Park, a cluster of family residences, forms an enclave directly adjacent to Stern Grove.

Rising more than 500 feet above central San Francisco and the shores of Ocean Beach, this mostly residential neighborhood is known for its eponymous park with a kids’ museum, trails and a beloved dog run. Streets in the neighborhood can be wide and flat, straight and narrow, or steep and winding, and are served by several buses and two nearby Muni lines. Surrounding neighborhoods offer shops and nightlife, but way up here you can enjoy peace, quiet and jaw-dropping views of downtown from some homes. 

An eclectic, elegant mix of detached homes and condos, Corona Heights housing travels through time from the Victorian era to present-day. Expect to see single-family homes mixed with detached town homes and small condo buildings. Park Hill, formerly St. Joseph’s Hospital and a backdrop for Alfred Hitchcock’s “Vertigo,” is the neighborhood’s largest condo complex directly across from Buena Vista Park.

## Factors to Consider When Choosing the Best San Francisco Neighborhood

Being “house-poor” isn’t fun. So understanding how much you can afford means making tradeoffs between San Francisco neighborhoods. While no neighborhood in SF is “cheap” you’ll find that the cost of housing varies widely as you traverse the hills and valleys of San Francisco’s best neighborhoods. While property taxes will be based on purchase price no matter where you live, what you get for what you are taxed on will vary widely. And that’s before we factor in transit time to schools, recreation, or anything else. 

Where are you spending your days now? Where are you likely to be spending them in the future? How do you want to get there? Some neighborhoods in SF offer great access to muni bus or light rail lines, while others are adored for their BART stops or stalked for their convenient on-ramps. Planning for your daily commute is a pivotal factor when selecting a neighborhood due to its major impact on daily life and your sense of well-being. The time and convenience of your daily travels significantly affect work-life balance, family time, and personal stress levels. Proximity to workplaces, schools, and essential services not only reduces commuting time but also minimizes transportation costs. Shorter commutes contribute to increased productivity and overall job satisfaction. Moreover, a neighborhood’s accessibility to public transportation and major thoroughfares influences ease of travel and connectivity, fostering a more efficient and enjoyable lifestyle. Considering commute in your decision-making process ensures a harmonious balance between professional commitments and personal pursuits, optimizing your overall living experience.

The age, style, shape, and characteristics of San Francisco housing stock vary wildly from one neighborhood to the next. The Sunset is known for single-family homes built primarily in the 1940s while you’re most likely to find a bungalow in Westwood Park. Full-amenity high-rises with valet and concierge services might be the norm in South Beach, but building heights like that are not allowed in most SF neighborhoods. 

Housing type is a crucial consideration when choosing a neighborhood as it directly shapes your living experience and lifestyle. Different neighborhoods offer diverse housing options, ranging from single-family homes to apartments or condominiums. The type of residence affects factors such as privacy, space, and maintenance responsibilities. Families may prioritize neighborhoods with spacious houses and yards, while young professionals might prefer the convenience of apartments in vibrant urban areas. Moreover, housing types impact community dynamics and the sense of belonging. Assessing your preferences and needs helps align your lifestyle with the neighborhood’s offerings, ensuring that your chosen housing type enhances your overall well-being and fits seamlessly with your daily routines and aspirations.

Amenities can be vital factors in choosing a neighborhood as they directly impact the overall lifestyle and value of a residence. Proximity to reputable schools influences educational opportunities and property values, making it crucial for families. Within a home, high-end appliances contribute to the comfort and functionality of a home, enhancing daily living standards. 

In larger buildings, doorpeople and front desk staff provide both security and convenience, adding to the sense of safety and luxury. Amenities contribute to the long-term desirability and resale value of a property. Considering such features ensures that your chosen neighborhood aligns with specific needs, preferences, and aspirations, creating a living environment that not only meets immediate requirements but also offers a lasting and high-quality residential experience.

Microclimates are a thing. If you like to sleep with your windows open and want to snuggle under a blanket in July while fog whispers through your windows, the Outer Sunset or Outer Richmond might delight you. If waking up to sunny skies and warmer temperatures is a requirement, then heading east of Twin Peaks to neighborhoods like The Mission or Mission Bay will leave you with a much sunnier disposition. Wind can delight or aggravate, and some parts of the city get a lot more of it than others, particularly when the temperature changes between the afternoon and evening. 

The Marina was once part of the bay and much of it is built on in-fill from the 1906 earthquake. Soil compaction and liquefaction may be of concern due to the history of how the neighborhood was built. The Shipyard was once Hunter’s Point Shipyard, with a variety of industrial and naval uses that may or may not still linger in the neighborhood. 

Anza Vista was once home to a cemetery while the Parkside was sand dunes for as far as the eye could see. SF neighborhoods currently filled with a diverse collection of homes and people may have begun as something much different, and depending on your personal preferences understanding how your current neighborhood came to be may or may not be important.
