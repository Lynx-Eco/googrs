It’s a list that tells the story of San Francisco through food, documenting the blend of taquerias, dumpling shops, and tasting menu destinations that make this city one of the most interesting places to eat in America. These are the places you don’t want to miss on your first trip to the Bay Area, and the ones worth returning to even if you’ve lived here for decades.</p>
                            <p id="PLJAie">And because we want to make sure this list reflects the ever-changing nature of San Francisco’s vibrant dining scene, we update the Eater 38 on a quarterly basis, adding restaurants that were previously overlooked, are newly eligible (Eater 38 restaurants must have been open for six months), or have stepped up their game. Sometimes a still great restaurant makes way for another one, in order to keep things new and fresh — and, importantly, to make sure that the Eater 38 is an inclusive and representative list.</p>

                            <p>It’s undeniable that the Fisherman’s Wharf of today may not quite live up to the rose-tinted memories of years gone by. But things remain reliably and pleasantly the same at Scoma’s, the nearly 60-year-old restaurant on the literal dock of the Bay. The menu will satisfy all your touristy seafood cravings for oysters, Dungeness crab cocktail, clam chowder, and cioppino, though the lengthy selections also include a spicy chicken sandwich and pasta with red sauce. Almost as much as the food, the space itself is the draw, whether you sit outside with the sound of lapping waves in the background or inside the wood-paneled dining room decorated with oodles of local sports paraphernalia.</p>

on the ground floor of a Fisherman’s Wharf hotel, the plant-filled restaurant further brightened by sunflower yellow banquettes and woven baskets from the southeast Asian archipelago. The dinner menu gives familiar dishes a modern California update — think, seafood pancit topped with smoked bay scallops, and longganisa pork sausage skewered on a thin stick and served with egg yolk and cane vinegar for dipping. Weekend brunch is a real treat, when you can truly appreciate the pastry skills of both Ang and                                <a href="https://sf.eater.com/2023/3/29/23660493/bay-area-san-francisco-2023-james-beard-awards-finalists-california">

. But Golden Boy remains an institution for good reason: It’s a rite of passage to stand on the sidewalk under that glowing neon sign waiting for your pan or slice while soaking in all that is the North Beach neighborhood. There are classic options including cheese, pepperoni, and sausage –- but the pro-move is to get the clam and garlic pie. It’s a zingy, briny, bready meal built on a doughy base with a sturdy bottom. Take your pizza to nearby Washington Square Park if the weather allows.</p>

. But there’s only one épicerie and café where diners can get a custardy cannelé and a slab of pâté en croûte — and that’s Maison Nico. Chef Nicolas Delaroque earned a Michelin star for his eponymous restaurant, but one global pandemic later he’s focused on fabulous brioche feuilletée; pâté en croûte studded with pork, butternut squash, and smoked eel; and an eye-catching ​​seafood aspic made with hunks of lobster, red snapper, mussels, and a bouillabaisse gelée. Pop by for a light lunch, but be warned some pastries may be sold out by midday.</p>

Plan ahead as the line can stretch for an hour or more during peak times, but if you arrive early (the restaurant opens at 11 a.m. daily) you can look forward to platters of fresh oysters served over ice after being pulled from waters up and down the West Coast. Supplement the feast with fried local anchovies, elegant crudo, or a remarkably good grilled cheese sandwich made with three varieties of melted cheese. With a glass of bubbles in hand and views of the bridge outside, it’s a meal to remember, whether you’re a local or just in town for a weekend.</p>

Lum Place in Chinatown, in the shadow of Portsmouth Square. It’s a dark and elegant space with comfortable booths and dramatic spotlighting above each table. There are no carts, but the food still shines, including bouncy shrimp and pork-stuffed shumai, impossibly thin and crisp scallion pancakes, and fluffy buns that explode with salted egg yolk custard. Service is prompt and polite making this a good option for a quicker sit-down meal.</p>

No matter: Step inside this narrow Chinatown mainstay and you’ll see there’s still plenty of history to go around. It’s a no-frills dining room with nimble if not overly attentive service. Go to experience classic Cantonese American cuisine including favorite dishes such as bouncy barbecue pork rice noodle rolls, ginger-scented jook, and wok-kissed chop suey.</p>

The name says it all: House of Prime Rib serves one thing and one thing only, and it does that roast prime rib very, very well. The only choices to make are: meat temperature, cut thickness, mashed or loaded baked potatoes, and martini or Manhattan. Each plate comes with a salad (prepared tableside), creamed spinach, Yorkshire pudding, and potatoes — and of course a hulking piece of beef cut from one of the wheeled meat carts.</p>

But the star of the show — and perhaps of the city’s entire Korean restaurant scene — is the kalbijjim, the slow-braised, spicy-sweet, fall-off-the-bone beef short rib stew that is Daeho’s claim to fame.</p>

Try the homey samusa soup or any of the fragrant noodle dishes, but whatever you do, don’t skip the best fermented tea leaf salad in town — a rendition of the classic that’s available without lettuce or cabbage to tamp down the deliciously pungent flavors or diminish the outrageous crunch of the nuts and seeds.</p>

The menu, which is constantly in flux, reflects whatever’s in season around the Bay Area and never seems to hold back on bold flavors and unexpected ingredient combinations. Bring a crew as the menu is comprised almost entirely of sharable plates – though you’ll definitely want a caviar potato cloud and a cup of “world peace” peanut milk entirely to yourself.</p>

By day, it’s a retail destination for fresh pastas of all shapes and sizes, as well as sauces, cheeses, compound butter, and pantry items galore.

Almost everything costs under $20 — just be prepared for a wait since there are no reservations offered. A second location of the restaurant is now open at 3233 22nd Street in the Mission.</p>

For dinner, start with addictive harissa cashews and a trio of spreads with pillowy flatbread before taking on plates of hand-rolled couscous, whole branzino, or braised lamb shank. Of course, never skip the basteeya, which comes wrapped in a flaky dough and stuffed with chicken confit and spiced almonds. For weekend brunch, the Moroccan pancakes are not to be missed.</p>

The chicken, meanwhile, deserves every last bit of praise.

But things remain reliably and pleasantly the same at Scoma’s, the nearly 60-year-old restaurant on the literal dock of the Bay. The menu will satisfy all your touristy seafood cravings for oysters, Dungeness crab cocktail, clam chowder, and cioppino, though the lengthy selections also include a spicy chicken sandwich and pasta with red sauce. Almost as much as the food, the space itself is the draw, whether you sit outside with the sound of lapping waves in the background or inside the wood-paneled dining room decorated with oodles of local sports paraphernalia.</p>

Try the homey samusa soup or any of the fragrant noodle dishes, but whatever you do, don’t skip the best fermented tea leaf salad in town — a rendition of the classic that’s available without lettuce or cabbage to tamp down the deliciously pungent flavors or diminish the outrageous crunch of the nuts and seeds.</p>

This eponymous restaurant, however, is her most polished yet, housed in a sunny corner space that transports diners far from the Bay and to a Southeast Asian night market. Eusope and her small but mighty staff serve four-course menus that change regularly but strive to give diners a taste of rare Mamak cuisine.

The menu, which is constantly in flux, reflects whatever’s in season around the Bay Area and never seems to hold back on bold flavors and unexpected ingredient combinations. Bring a crew as the menu is comprised almost entirely of sharable plates – though you’ll definitely want a caviar potato cloud and a cup of “world peace” peanut milk entirely to yourself.</p>

For dinner, start with addictive harissa cashews and a trio of spreads with pillowy flatbread before taking on plates of hand-rolled couscous, whole branzino, or braised lamb shank. Of course, never skip the basteeya, which comes wrapped in a flaky dough and stuffed with chicken confit and spiced almonds. For weekend brunch, the Moroccan pancakes are not to be missed.</p>
